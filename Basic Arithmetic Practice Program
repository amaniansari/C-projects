/*
Welcome to the Math Tutor!
Select an operation (+ - / *): *
11 * 1 = 11
That's right

Another problem? y
Select an operation (+ - / *): -
8 - 5 = 3
That's right

Another problem? y
Select an operation (+ - / *): /
42 / 7 = 6
That's right

Another problem? Y
Select an operation (+ - / *): *
9 * 5 = 50
The answer is 45

Another problem? Y
Select an operation (+ - / *): +
1 + 5 = 8
The answer is 6

Another problem? Y
Select an operation (+ - / *): -
11 - 3 = 8
That's right

Another problem? Y
Select an operation (+ - / *): /
40 / 8 = 5
That's right

Another problem? n
GAME STATISTICS
Number of problems:     7
